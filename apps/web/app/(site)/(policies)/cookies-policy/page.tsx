      <h2>Cookie Notice</h2>
      <p>
        When you access or use Umati, we may place Cookies on your device. These
        Cookies help us to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Enable the core functionality of Umati such as creating or joining a
          game lobby, maintaining your session, or storing your settings;
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember your preferences (for example, your nickname, theme or
          language);
        </li>
        <li>
          Collect aggregated usage and performance data to improve the Website;
        </li>
        <li>Ensure the Website is secure and runs reliably.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By continuing to use the Website, you consent to our placement and use
        of Cookies as described in this policy—unless you disable them. If you
        do not accept Cookies, you can disable or remove them via your browser
        settings—but this may impact your ability to use some or all features of
        Umati.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Cookies</h2>
      <p>We use various types of Cookies on our Website, grouped as follows:</p>

      <h3>1. Essential / Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        These Cookies are required for the Website to work and cannot be
        switched off in our system. They support core functions such as managing
        your login or game session. Without these Cookies, certain features may
        not operate.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Performance / Analytics Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        These Cookies allow us to count visits, monitor traffic sources, and
        measure how users interact with Umati. The data is aggregated and
        generally anonymous. While disabling them may reduce our ability to
        understand and improve the experience, it will not stop you using the
        core service.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Functional Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        These Cookies enable the Website to remember your preferences and
        provide enhanced, more personal features (for example your preferred
        nickname, theme or game history). If you disable them, these preferences
        may not be retained.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Targeting / Advertising Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        At this time, Umati does not engage in third-party advertising or
        behavioural targeting cookies. (If this changes, we will update this
        policy accordingly.)
      </p>

      <h3>5. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        Some of our service providers (for example analytics or hosting) may
        place Cookies via Umati. You may also encounter cookies set by external
        domains when using embedded features or third-party integrations. Please
        check the relevant third-party provider’s cookie policy for more
        details.
      </p>

      <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
      <p>Here is how we use Cookies on Umati:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To enable you to log in, create or join a lobby, play interactive
          party games and maintain your game session in real-time.
        </li>
        <li>
          To remember your preferences (such as nickname, theme, language, game
          history) so that you don’t need to re-enter them each time you use
          Umati.
        </li>
        <li>
          To collect aggregated usage statistics (for example number of game
          sessions per day, most popular game modes) which help us improve
          Umati, fix bugs, and plan new features.
        </li>
        <li>
          To ensure the security, reliability and performance of the Website
          (for example detecting/mitigating abuse, maintaining session
          integrity).
        </li>
        <li>
          (If applicable) To manage third-party services such as analytics
          providers or hosting platforms which assist in providing the Website.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can disable or delete Cookies at any time via your browser or device
        settings. Note that blocking or deleting certain Cookies may impair your
        ability to use Umati (for example you might have to log in each time or
        lose game session continuity).
      </p>

      <h2>Change of Cookie Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in
        our services, cookies used, regulatory requirements or operational
        practices. The “Last updated” date at the top of this policy will
        indicate when this policy was last revised.
      </p>
      <p>
        We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed.
        Your continued use of Umati after we post changes will constitute your
        acceptance of the updated policy.
